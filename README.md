Masterkorp's Awesome configuration
==================================
This is my awesome wm config, originaly based on Guff's config.

This branch is for legacy support of 3.4

### Testing
You can test the config with the debug.sh script on the scripts folder. Opens a
nested X session, so it can be tested within another WM
